# Java Improved Math Random()
Improvements on the `Math.random()` method allowing you to specify:
- An upper bound representing **range** (not just `doubles` between 0 & 1)
- A lower bound

## Double Functions `random()`
- Upper bound is always excluded

## Integer Functions  `randInt()`
- 1-parameter version does not include the upper bound, but lower bound is 0
- 2-parameter version DOES have inclusive upper bound
